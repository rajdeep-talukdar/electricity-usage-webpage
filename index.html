  In 2019, world total electricity final consumption reached 22 848 TWh, up 1.7% from 2018.<br>
  In 2019, OECD total electricity final consumption was 9 672 TWh, 1.1% lower<br>

<div class="electricity_production">Electricity Production
<p class="electricity_production_p">
  In 2019, world gross electricity production was 1.3% higher than 2018. Global electricity production<br>
  has grown each year continuously since 1974, except for between 2008 and 2009,<br>
  when the global financial crisis sharply cut demand. In 2019, non OECD countries share of production<br>
  reached 58.6% of world electricity generation - more than double the share they held in 1974.<br>
  Increasing energy efficiency limited annual production growth between 2010 and 2019 to just 0.1%<br>
  in OECD countries (membership as of April 2021), compared with 4.6% in non OECD countries.<br>

  Trading electricity between countries has become much more common in recent years.<br>
  In the OECD, imports of electricity grew from 89 TWh in 1974 to 496 TWh in 2020,<br>
  representing an average annual growth rate of 3.8%, compared to the 1.9% growth in<br>
  overall electricity supply.<br>Substantial trade in electricity occurs in OECD Europe, where electricity imports<br>
  grew at an average annual rate of 3.9% between 1974 and 2020.<br>

        <h2 class="section__title">Efficient Electricity Usage: Tips to Save Power and Money</h2>
        <h1 class="tips">
          <p>1. Turn off lights when not in use: Encourage everyone in your household or workplace to switch off lights in unoccupied rooms.
          Consider using motion sensor lights or timers to automatically turn off lights when they're not needed.</p><br>

          <p>2. Use energy-efficient appliances: When purchasing new appliances, look for the ENERGY STAR label,
            which indicates that the product meets energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
            Energy-efficient appliances consume less electricity and can save you money on your energy bills.</p><br>

          <p>3. Unplug chargers when devices are fully charged: Many electronic devices continue to draw power even when they're not in use.
            Unplug chargers for smartphones, laptops, and other devices once they're fully charged to prevent unnecessary energy consumption.</p><br>

          <p>4. Take advantage of natural light: During the day, open curtains and blinds to allow natural light into your home or workspace.
            Use task lighting rather than overhead lighting whenever possible to reduce electricity usage.</p><br>

          <p>5. Set air conditioning to an optimal temperature: Adjust your thermostat to a comfortable but energy-efficient temperature.
            In the summer, set your air conditioner to around 78°F (25°C) when you're at home and raise the temperature when you're away.
            In the winter, lower the thermostat and use extra blankets or layers of clothing to stay warm.</p><br>

          <p>6. Use ceiling fans: Ceiling fans can help circulate air and make rooms feel cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
            Use ceiling fans in conjunction with your heating and cooling systems to reduce energy usage.</p><br>

          <p>7. Seal air leaks: Inspect doors, windows, and other openings for air leaks that can allow warm or cool air to escape,
            forcing your heating and cooling systems to work harder. Seal any gaps or cracks with weatherstripping or caulking to improve energy efficiency.</p><br>

          <p>8. Opt for energy-efficient lighting: Replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient options such as LED or CFL bulbs.
            These bulbs use less energy and last longer than incandescent bulbs, saving you money on both energy costs and replacement bulbs.</p><br>

          <p>9. Use power strips: Plug electronic devices and appliances into power strips that can be easily switched off when not in use.
            This prevents standby power consumption, also known as vampire power, which occurs when devices continue to draw power even when turned off.</p><br>

          <p>10. Practice energy-saving habits: Encourage everyone in your household or workplace to adopt energy-saving habits such as turning off lights and electronics when leaving a room,
            running full loads in the dishwasher and washing machine, and using cold water for laundry whenever possible. These small changes can add up to significant energy savings over time.</p>
